# Data Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

![Alt text](data.png?raw=true "Data Pipeline")

The data pipeline is responsible for training the machine learning model, generating artifacts, and storing them for further use in the deployment pipeline.

## Prerequisites

1. Dataset for training the ML model.
2. ML codebase with scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and artifact generation.
3. GitHub repository for version control and automation.

## Pipeline Structure

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the dataset for training.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts relevant features and transforms data.
3. **Model Training**: Trains the machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the trained model's performance using validation data.
5. **Artifact Generation**: Saves the trained model and associated files as artifacts.

## Pipeline Configuration

- Triggered manually or scheduled based on data availability and model update frequency.
- Uses Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, or similar tools for data processing and model training.
- Utilizes GitHub Actions or CI/CD tools for automation and version control.

## Usage

1. Ensure dataset is available and accessible.
2. Customize data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training scripts as per requirements.
3. Set up GitHub repository secrets for credentials and sensitive information.
4. Schedule pipeline runs or trigger manually based on data updates or model improvements.
5. Monitor pipeline logs and outputs for errors, performance metrics, and artifact generation.

## Troubleshooting

- Check input data quality and completeness.
- Debug scripts for preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- Monitor resource usage and scalability for large datasets and complex models.
